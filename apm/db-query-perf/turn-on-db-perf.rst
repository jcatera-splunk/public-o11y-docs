   :description: Learn how to enable Database Query Performance in Splunk APM so you can monitor the impact of your database queries on service availability. 

Database Query Performance is available by default, so all you need to do is turn on the feature so that APM automatically begins indexing a set of database-related span tags. See :ref:`db-tags` for the list of tags.

.. note:: Indexing Database Query Performance tags counts toward the MetricSet entitlement in your Splunk APM contract. See :ref:`apm-limits-metricsets` to learn more about cardinality in APM.

Prerequisites
==============================================

* To use Database Query Performance, you need an instrumented back-end service that connects to at least one database. See :ref:`get-started-application`.
* You must be a Splunk Observability Cloud admin to turn on Database Query Performance.

Turn on Database Query Performance
==============================================

Follow these steps to turn on Database Query Performance and begin indexing database tags:

1. From the APM landing page, select :guilabel:`APM Configuration` and select :guilabel:`APM MetricSets`. The APM MetricSets page opens.

    .. note:: Before proceeding, ensure that you have configured the instrumentation for your specific programming language:
            * Java, see :ref:`_instrument-java-applications`.
            * .NET, see :ref:`instrument-dotnet-application.html#database-query-performance-settings`.
            * Python, see :ref:`instrument-python-application`. 
            * Node.js, see :ref:`instrument-nodejs-application`.                   

2. In the Database Query Performance section, check that the :guilabel:`Status` is Active. If it is, skip to the next step. If it's not, select :guilabel:`Resume Indexing` to initiate cardinality analysis, and then wait for the cardinality analysis to run in the Pending MetricSet section at the top of the table.

         :alt: Cardinality analysis for indexing new span tags passing within entitlement.

    a. If the cardinality analysis passes within entitlement, as in the screenshot, select the check mark to accept the cardinality contribution and begin indexing database tags.
    b. If the cardinality contribution exceeds your entitlement, consider reviewing the cardinality contributions of your other indexed span tags to free up cardinality for Database Query Performance. To learn more about optimizing cardinality, see :ref:`apm-limits-metricsets`. 

3. Navigate to the APM landing page and select the :guilabel:`Database Query Performance` card to confirm databases are appearing in Database Query Performance. If they are not appearing as expected, see :ref:`db-perf-troubleshooting`.
