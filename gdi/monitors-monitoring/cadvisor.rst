   :description: Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the cAdvisor monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector uses the Smart Agent receiver with the
cAdvisor monitor type to pull metrics directly from cAdvisor. By
default, it runs on port 4194, but it can be configured to any other
port.

If you are using Kubernetes, consider the
:ref:`kubelet-stats-receiver` because many Kubernetes nodes do not
expose cAdvisor on a network port, even though they are running it
within Kubelet.

.. :note:: The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector cannot collect specific cgroup metrics exposed by cAdvisor, such as ``container_cpu_cfs_*`` 
   in managed environments such as Amazon EKS, and the supported `kubeletstats` receiver does not expose these metrics by default.

If you are running containers with Docker, retrieved metrics might
overlap with ``docker-container-stats``. Consider not enabling the
Docker monitor in a Kubernetes environment, or else use filtering to
allow only certain metrics. This will cause the built-in Docker
dashboards to be blank, but container metrics will be available on the
Kubernetes dashboards instead.

This integration is available on Kubernetes, Linux, and Windows.
