HTTP forwarder extension

      :description: Accepts HTTP requests and optionally adds headers and forwards them.

The Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector supports the HTTP forwarder extension. Documentation is planned for a future release.

Splunk Observability Cloud uses OpenTelemetry to correlate telemetry types. To do this, your telemetry field names or metadata key names must exactly match the metadata key names used by both OpenTelemetry and Splunk Observability Cloud. To ensure your metadata key names are correctly named, see :ref:`relatedcontent-collector`.
