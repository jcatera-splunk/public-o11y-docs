   :description:  Manage users: Add one or more roles to a user in Splunk Observability Cloud.


   
You can assign roles to existing and new users to determine what they can do and which features they can access in Splunk Observability Cloud. For example, certain roles allow users to create detectors or dashboards.

Users can have multiple roles at the same time. See :ref:`roles-and-capabilities` for more information. For details about each role and the associated capabilities, see :ref:`roles-table-phase`.

.. note:: To create or manage users, you must have administrator access. To get this access, an existing administrator adds it to your user profile. See :ref:`admin-manage-users` for more information.
